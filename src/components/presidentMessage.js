                The United Greek Council was established at the University of Washington with the help of advisor Rene Singleton who worked under the UW Student Activities Office. We felt as if there was a need for representation on our college campus, especially as we witnessed a growth in our Asian and Latino Greek communities. Established in 2002, the United Greek Council continues to aim to unify historically underrepresented chapters on campus and since then, we have grown and now oversee twelve different organizations.

                As UGC President for the 2018-19 academic year, I hope to continue to improve our communication skills with our members by becoming more transparent about our ideas and how we plan on executing our goals. As always, we aim to increase member involvement at our community events by better advertising them and striving to ensure that our entity stays a safe and welcoming space for all, no matter their ethnicity or culture. Being a part of the United Greek Council brings us together as one; “In Unity, there is strength”. By coming together, we can impart unto ourselves a mutual sense of community, culture, and most importantly, academics - the three pillars that UGC is built on. Through cultural diversity and understanding, UGC unites minority Greek organizations at UW and offers opportunities for members to grow as leaders within their own communities and build professional skills.

                The best thing I did in my college career was become a member of my organization. My brotherhood exposed me to countless opportunities that I could not have achieved on my own and gave me that sense of family that I was looking for on large college campuses such as the UW. It presented me opportunities to network with individuals on different career paths than my own and if I needed anything, I knew that they’d have my back. To all prospective members out there looking to go Greek, I recommend you to explore your options and find an organization that you think will best fit your personality and values, and I guarantee that it may just help you meet your personal and professional goals while attending the University of Washington!
